Step 2: Install Git (IMPORTANT OPTIONS)

During installation:

✔ Click Next until you see
“Adjusting your PATH environment”

👉 Select THIS option (VERY IMPORTANT):

✅ Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software

Then:

Keep default options

Finish install

🔹 Step 3: RESTART EVERYTHING

This is NOT optional.

🔁 Restart:

VS Code

PowerShell / CMD

(Safest) Restart your PC

🔹 Step 4: Verify Git is installed

Open VS Code → Terminal and run:

git --version


✅ You should see something like:

git version 2.44.0.windows.1

🚀 Then retry your commands

git commit -am "update"
git push






uploads files to github
1️⃣ Open your project folder

Go to your project folder
👉 Right-click → “Open Git Bash here”

2️⃣ Initialize git
git init

3️⃣ Add ALL files
git add .


Check:

git status


You should see files in green.

4️⃣ Commit files
git commit -m "upload project files"

5️⃣ Create repository on GitHub

Open https://github.com

Click New

Repository name → anything

❌ Do NOT add README

Click Create repository

6️⃣ Connect your folder to GitHub

Copy the HTTPS URL from GitHub, then run:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git


for change the your_repro_name

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/merrooo/NDEDC_Smart_Meter.git


Check:

git remote -v

7️⃣ Upload (PUSH) files 🚀
git branch -M main
git pull
git push -u origin main

If GitHub asks for password

⚠️ Use Personal Access Token, NOT your password

Create token:

GitHub → Settings → Developer settings
→ Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
→ Generate new token
→ ✅ repo
→ Copy token

👉 Paste token as password

❌ ERROR FIXES (VERY COMMON)
❌ failed to connect to github.com port 443

Run:

git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy


Then try push again.

❌ remote origin already exists
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

✅ DONE

Open your repository on GitHub
You will see all your files uploaded 🎉

👉 If it STILL doesn’t upload

Copy exact error message and paste it here.
I’ll fix it with you line by line 💪

 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/merrooo/Comercial_React'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. If you want to integrate the remote changes,
hint: use 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Perfect — thanks for pasting the exact error 👍
This is a very common Git issue and easy to fix.

❌ What this error means (simple words)

Your GitHub repo already has files
(like a README or something you created on GitHub)

Your local folder doesn’t have them yet, so Git refuses to push.

✅ THE CORRECT FIX (SAFE WAY)
🔹 Step 1: Pull GitHub files first

Run exactly this:

git pull origin main --rebase


🔐 If asked → use GitHub token as password.

🔹 Step 2: Push again
git push -u origin main


✅ This should work.

🧠 Why --rebase?

Keeps history clean

Avoids merge conflicts

Best for beginners

❌ If you get a merge editor screen (VIM)

If this screen appears:

# Please enter a commit message...


Do this:

Press ESC

Type:

:wq


Press Enter

🚨 IF YOU JUST WANT TO OVERWRITE GITHUB (DANGER)

⚠️ This will DELETE files on GitHub and replace them with yours.

git push -f origin main


Use only if you are 100% sure.

✅ FINAL CHECK

Open:

https://github.com/merrooo/Comercial_React




git add.
git commit -am "Anything"
git push
git status

You should see your files 🎉
